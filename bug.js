The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This often happens when you're working with asynchronous operations and you attempt to read data before the Firebase server has had time to complete the request. For example, if you try to access data inside a callback function that hasn't completed yet, you might encounter this issue.
